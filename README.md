I did this project for the Odin project.

It uses a grid of div's created in java script to create an Etch a Sketch. This is more to show off js than css (granted I find myself needing wayyyy more time for css than anything else because I have a lot more experience in programming languages).

You can hold shift to erase specific squares.

There are three buttons:
Black- Selects the pen to be black, selected by default
Random Color- Makes the pen draw in a random color, if you go over a color that is not black or white while on this mode, it will darken that color.
Reset- Turns the whole grid back to white
